This website is an imitation of the famous kids' toy, etch-a-sketch. The user can choose to draw on the board using eihter black or random colours. There is also an eraser to fix mistakes. The reset button gives you a clean grid again and the "change grid dimnesions" button can be used to change the dimensions of the grid.
